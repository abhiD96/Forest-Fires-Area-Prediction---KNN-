# Forest-Fires-Area-Prediction---KNN-

It is a course mini-project to build a KNN algorithm to predict the area of forest fires in the foreseable future. The following steps are given below:
1. Web-Scraping Forest fires data from URL http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/forestfires/forestfires and clean the dataset
2. Standardizing data using z-score standardization
3. Creating a KNN algorithm - using eucledian distance to find distance between observations and using mode to get K
4. Testing the developed KNN algorithm
5. Determining the optimal value of K
